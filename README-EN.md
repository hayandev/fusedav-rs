# fusedav-rs

fusedav-rs is a WebDAV client that can be mounted via FUSE.

Unfortunately, I'm "good enough" with the features of this project.\
So, I DO NOT PROMISE ANY MAINTENANCE.

If there are features you want, just fork and work for yourself.

Thanks, and have a good time with your WebDAV server.

# Feature

Asynchronous list/get ONLY.

I have no plans to provide any other features.
